# Contribute to ResinOS
There are many ways to contribute to ResinOS, based on your skills and interests. Whether you are an embedded linux expert or a casual user, you can find areas where you can make a big difference!

## Testing and Bug Reports
Nobody likes buggy software! If you encounter any problems while using ResinOS, you can submit an [issue on github](https://github.com/resin-os/meta-resin/issues). Please include as much information about the problem as possible.

The same applies for the [ResinOS board support](https://github.com/resin-os?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=resin-) repositories as well, if you are reporting issues specific to a particular hardware.

## Submitting Fixes
If you check out the [issues](https://github.com/resin-os/meta-resin/issues) reported for ResinOS, and you find any that you feel you’d like to fix, you can submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your proposed change. Please observe the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/resin-os/meta-resin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The same applies for the [ResinOS board support](https://github.com/resin-os?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=resin-) repositories as well, if you are fixing issues specific to a particular hardware.

## Support to Additional Boards
ResinOS intended to work with any kind of boards that fulfill some basic hardware requirements (see our Supported Boards list for currently supported devices). If you have any other board that you’d like to see on that list, please check our [board support contribution guide](https://github.com/meta-resin/blob/master/contributing-device-support.md) for more details. You’ll need to be familiar with [Yocto](http://www.yoctoproject.org/), and the board you are adding.

## Documentation
ResinOS is quickly evolving, and having good documentation that keeps up with the changes is crucial. If you find any information that is incomplete or missing, you can submit improvements to our documentation on Github!

## Tutorials
Tutorials, how-to guides, and blog posts regarding using ResinOS are always welcome. This would help us figure out how to make ResinOS more usable for everyone, and also help new users to get started. If you have any tutorials and guides, please let us know in the [ResinOS chat](https://gitter.im/resin-os/chat).
