Make sure your {{ $device.name }} development board is powered off. Insert the SD card from the previous step and plug in the power cord. Press and hold the power button for one second to turn the device on.

__Note:__ This will also completely erase internal storage media, so please make a backup first.

After resinOS has been flashed onto the internal storage, the board will shut itself off automatically and the power LED will turn off. You can then safely remove the SD card.

Your {{ $device.name }} is now ready to run an application. Press the power button once more to turn it on, and get ready to make your first code deploy!
