# Deploying

After a PR has been created, a member of the resin team will review and merge into master.

Shortly after merging to master it'll automatically be deployed to our [staging environment](https://resin-os-staging.herokuapp.com/) (This should only take a few minutes).

Once deployed to staging, you can preview your changes. If everything looks good, a member of the resin team will make another PR from master into the production branch. When this is merged, the changes will automatically deploy to production.
