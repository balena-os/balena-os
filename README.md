# [Deprecated] balenaOS Website & Documentation 

This repository's contents have been migrated to https://github.com/balena-io/resin-site/

Both the [balenaOS website](https://balena.io/os) and the [balenaOS Docs](https://www.balena.io/os/docs) are now being built at https://github.com/balena-io/resin-site/

If you don't have access to the repository to make a pull request and suggest changes, please make a [new issue](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/issues/new) on the [balena-io/docs](https://github.com/balena-io/docs/) repository. 

For any changes or suggestions about balenaOS on supported device types or meta-balena in general, please open an issue on the respective repository in https://github.com/balena-os/. There will be a repostiory associated with each device type with the format `balena-<deviceType>`. For example, raspberrypi devices have [balena-raspberrypi](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-raspberrypi/) or Intel devices have [`balena-intel`](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-intel).

For issues, with the base yocto layer for building balenaOS or generally about balenaOS, head on to [meta-balena](https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena)
